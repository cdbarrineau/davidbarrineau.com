            The National Training Center (NTC), located at Ft. Irwin California, is the biggest training facility in the world.  It covers
            over 1,000 square miles (2,600km<sup>2</sup>).  It is known for training full Battalions of soldiers at any given time.  Each
            training exercise is known as a "rotation".  A rotation last four to five days and runs 24 hours a day.  There are multiple
            parts to a rotation but the part I worked on was the live-fire part which is the most exciting.  This is where dismounted
            soldiers, HMMWVs, Tanks, and even Aircraft all train at the same time, advancing on Opposing Force (OPFOR) targets.  Like
            most targets in training on other ranges, these are mechanical devices that expose silhouettes for Soldiers to shoot at and
            are scored on their shooting accuracy.  During the live-fire part of a rotation, personnel that run the Rotation for the Soldiers
            are stationed in the middle of the desert in a single build called the "Bunker".  When contractors, which include Program 
            Managers, engineers, etc. are on site, they have to stay at the Bunker the entire time, day and night as they close off roads
            in fear that soldiers will mistake a civilian vehicle for a target and shoot at it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was assigned to a project that would replace a large amount of the software used to run the live-fire portion of the training.
            The old system had become obsolete and was too much to maintain both financially and logistically.  We reused parts of 
            <a href="tracr.html">TRACR</a> however, there was a lot of custom software to be written that NTC live-fire required.  I was
            the sole person on this endeavor.  I was in charge of requirements gathering of what NTC needed, architecting, designing and
            implementing the new solution.  Additionally, I was on site a lot for integration testing and all other formal government
            testing.  (Yes, I spent a few rotations at the Bunker, sleeping in my rental truck when I could!)
          </p>
          <p>
            The live-fire system I designed and implements consisted of multiple parts, both servers and clients.  I had to interface
            to an existing CORBA implementation for some data, luckily I had CORA experience with my time at <a href="tracr.html">Kennedy Space Center</a>.
            The new parts of the system I was able to use whatever I wanted to get the job done which again was client-server-based.  At the time
            .NET C# was the predominate language used on the Product Line that this effort was under.  Therefore, the clients and back-end
            processes were written in .NET C#.  There was also Java written on the server-side that was run in Wildfly application server.  Finally,
            for event distribution, it was a combination of RabbitMQ and CORBA, depending on the sending and receiving components.  I used
            PostgreSQL for the database as well as Hibernate for the ORM.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the biggest things to come out of the effort for the users of the system was a mobile solution.  Personnel that ran
            the training would have to ride with the Commanding Officer(s) in HMMWVs while training was in full-swing.  These workers
            on the ground had to have near-real-time feeds in the form of text and images rendered on a map as soldiers and targets
            changed.  Initially the only form of wireless communication to these mobile solutions were via a UHF-band serial connection--
            one connection for the hundreds of targets deployed in the training area.  Therefore, this solution had to be small and scale
            very well.  Later, the Army paid for AT&T towers to be put in so that we could utilize cell signals for this communication
            however, that was years after the initial deployment I did.
          </p>
          <p>
            This solution lasted for over ten years until what the government calls a "tech-refresh" is being put into place utilizing
            new technology and hardware.  No more CORBA!  Everything will be browser-based and all back-end components written in Java
            and run in Spring Boot applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm glad to have played a big part in the decade that live-fire training occurred at the NTC.  I learned a lot about
            how to architect large-scale systems, interfacing with existing systems, and met a lot of great people!
