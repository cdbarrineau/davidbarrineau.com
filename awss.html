        The Aerial Weapons Scoring System (AWSS) II allows the training and qualification of aviation crews utilizing hardware devices that detect several
        forms of shots from a helicopter.  AWSS II is a side-project to <a class="normal-font-link" href="tracr.html">TRACR</a>.  In terms of Domain-Driven-Design,
        this project is a subdomain of <a class="normal-font-link" href="tracr.html">TRACR</a>.  There are three main weapons that are fired from an aviation
        vehicle: Bullets, Lasers, and Rockets.  Each of these weapons have separate criteria for scoring but all use the same types of hardware sensors for
        detecting hits.  Like 
        <a class="normal-font-link" href="kdas.html">KDAS</a>, the same types of sensors are used for AWSS II.  As stated for
        <a class="normal-font-link" href="kdas.html">KDAS</a>, I was tasked with developing an Interface Control Document (ICD) that allows the sensors to communicate
        with the software system.  This required good communication between not only the vendor and myself, but for other stakeholders such as the customer and
        the Project Manager.
      </p>
      <p class="case-study-p">
        The problem space is that there is an existing solution however that solution has become too expensive to maintain and the hardware sensors are only
        available from one vendor.  Therefore vendor lock-in became a major pain-point for the Army.  Additionally, other pain points were that the scoring
        software itself has become end of life due to the age of the solution.  At the time of this writing, the current solution is almost two decades old.  Therefore,
        the Army wanted a new solution that would both reduce cost of maintaining the sensors and software along with integration into the new
        <a class="normal-font-link" href="tracr.html">TRACR</a> solution for seamless integration.  Due to the nature of where the application runs, there is no
        internet connectivity therefore the entire solution is run on premises at a particular training range.  The reason for this is due to the weapons fired--
        there must not be any structures, towns, etc. for miles.
      </p>
      <p class="case-study-p">
        Since <a class="normal-font-link" href="tracr.html">TRACR</a> is an existing product, AWSS II had to conform to the overall Product Line that
        <a class="normal-font-link" href="tracr.html">TRACR</a> is a part.  In order to facilitate that, I had to use
        <a class="normal-font-link" target="_blank" href="https://sparxsystems.com/products/ea/">Enterprise Architect by Sparx</a> for modeling of the AWSS II subdomain.  We use
        this tool to both model and export the domain models via Swagger files to be used in code generation.  The generated code adheres to the principles of
        a microservice architecture.
      </p>
      <p class="case-study-p">
        The actual technology used is Java on the back-end with Spring Boot.  The front-end consists of a Single Page Application (SPA) written in Angular.
        The Product Line uses Postgres for the datastore and RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication from different microservices and to the user interface.
