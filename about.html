        I'm a Senior Architect working for a firm out of Orlando Florida.  I've worked
        for this company for over 20 years on mainly US DoD contracts that help train the military
        for battle by qualifying Marines and Soldiers in everything from Small Arms to tanks to
        aviation.  Before that I worked for the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on software to
        replace the existing system to launch the Space Shuttle.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have held multiple roles during the past 25 years for software engineering, from junior
        through senior roles and currently an architect. I hold multiple certifications ranging from Soft Skills to Agile to
        AWS Solutions Architect - Professional.
      </p>
        I currently live in Virginia in the USA.  I am passionate about learning and also love being with my family.  I play guitar
        and I love to surf though that is a tough one in Virginia!  I have three children and one great wife.
