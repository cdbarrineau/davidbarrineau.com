          I'm a Senior Architect working for a firm out of Orlando Florida.  I've worked
          for this company for over 20 years on mainly US DoD contracts that help train the military
          for battle by qualifying Marines and Soldiers in everything from Small Arms to tanks to
          aviation.  Before that I worked for the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on software to
          replace the existing system to launch the Space Shuttle.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have held multiple roles during the past 25 years for software engineering, from junior
          through senior roles and currently an architect. 
        </p>
          I hold multiple certifications ranging from Soft Skills to Agile to AWS Solutions Architect - Professional.

             The Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is famous for the launching of manned rockets since the Mercury program in the 1961
             when Alan Sheparrd was the first American in space.  Perhaps, other than the rocket that put a man on the moon, it 
             is most famous for the Space Shuttle.
