          As a passionate Software Architect with over 20 years of experience in designing and building scalable, high-performance
          software systems, I thrive on solving complex problems and turning innovative ideas into reality. My expertise spans
          across system architecture, cloud-native technologies, microservices, and ensuring robust, maintainable codebases that
          align with both business goals and user needs.Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of leading cross-functional teams,
          collaborating with stakeholders, and driving the technical vision for projects that range from enterprise-level solutions to
          cutting-edge startups. I excel in creating technical roadmaps, guiding development practices, and mentoring developers to elevate
          their skills while fostering a culture of continuous learning.
        </p>
          I am committed to staying ahead of the curve, always exploring emerging technologies like AI, cloud patterns, and
          containerization to ensure the solutions I build are future-proof and aligned with industry trends. My approach is rooted in a
          deep understanding of business objectives, allowing me to design systems that are not only technically sound but also
          strategically aligned with the broader goals of the organization.
        <p>
          Whether I'm optimizing an existing system or designing from scratch, I am always focused on delivering value and ensuring
          long-term scalability and maintainability.
        </p>

            Coord Grabber is an application that allows the user to click on a spot of the earth and get the UTM coordinates for the
            clicked spot.  This is used for placement of assets such as targetry devices.

            The Known Distance Automated Scoring (KDAS) solution is a custom built scoring system used by the Marines to qualify
            with their rifles and machine guns.  This training is essential for Marines to see how well they shoot
            so that they can use their weapons in battle.

             The Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is famous for the launching of manned rockets since the Mercury program in the 1961
             when Alan Sheparrd was the first American in space.  Perhaps, other than the rocket that put a man on the moon, it 
             is most famous for the Space Shuttle.
