          I'm a Senior Architect working for a firm out of Orlando Florida.  I've worked
          for this company for over 20 years on mainly US DoD contracts that help train the military
          for battle by qualifying Marines and Soldiers in everything from Small Arms to tanks to
          aviation.  Before that I worked for the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on software to
          replace the existing system to launch the Space Shuttle.
        </p>

          I have held multiple roles during the past 25 years for software engineering, from junior
          through senior roles and currently an architect.
