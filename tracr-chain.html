        TRACR Chain is an emerging AWS application that is used by the military to view and colocate information about how soldiers, crews, and units
        train.  Its input is the data obtained by onsite applications that have no internet connectivity.  The data is exported by a custom application
        to a soldier's phone then uploaded to the TRACR Chain AWS application.  Users of TRACR Chain can then "slice and dice" the data from multiple
        units to view how their training ranks among other soldiers, crews, and units.  Until now, there was no way to easily combine and view data for
        soldiers, crews, and units in a unified way.  The best that could be done is to have paper printouts of training scores and tools such as Excel
        would be used to colocate data as much as possible.  However, this method is error prone and does not allow the user to dynamically view and 
        reason about tens to hundreds of datasets.  TRACR Chain alleviates this limitation by automating the collection of data into a central repository
        so that evaluators can more easily reason about the "rollup" data.
      </p>
      <p class="case-study-p">
        The AWS technically used in TRACR Chain includes various aspects of AWS.  In order to log into the application, AWS Amplify provides access to
        an AWS Cognito where users are managed to authorize and authenticate that a user is allowed access to TRACR Chain.
      </p>
      <p class="case-study-p">
        The TRACR Chain application itself is composed of four microservices: Soldier, Crew, Unit, and the UI.  Each of these microservices is a Docker
        container whose images are stored on the AWS Elastic Container Registry.  When a software update is made, it is pushed to GitHub and there is a 
        GitHub Webhook that kicks off an AWS Code Pipeline build and deployment.  The containers are then pushed to AWS's Elastic Container Service (ECS)
        on a Fargate deployment.  Since there are multiple containers, the use of a Docker network is utilized since the containers must communicate with
        each other.  Additionally, CloudFront as the CDN is utilized to enable faster access to the application based on geographic location.  TRACR Chain
        uses Route 53 with a custom domain to access the application.  SSL/TLS certificates, issued by AWS Certificate Manager, are used to provide security
        to the application.  In order to store data, the use of AWS RDS (Postgres) is used.  Realtime events are needed for the application.  Therefore, the
        application uses AWS's Amazon MQ with ApacheMQ.  This provides asynchronous updates from the back-end to the front-end.  In order for services to
        access resources like databases, ApacheMQ, etc.  connection strings and passwords are stored in AWS's Parameter Store as Secret Strings.  While the
        use of Secrets Manager could be used, the decision was made to use the Parameter Store because of a lower cost.  Finally, all resources are defined
        by CloudFormation templates.  This allows for repeatable deployments and adheres to the IaC principle.
      </p>
      <p class="case-study-p">
        All containers expect for the UI are Java-based applications using Spring Boot.  The UI is an Angular application that uses Apache to serve the application.
