        When I set out to create my own website, there was a plethora of solutions available.  Anyone that has developed a website knows
        that the possibilities of how and where to deploy a website seems almost infinite.  Having a strong background on AWS seemed like
        a good starting point for where to deploy this website.  I researched alternatives such as Wix but AWS gave me an all-in-one
        solution whose services easily integrated with each other.  For instance, on AWS you can do everything that is needed for a production website,
        from buying a domain name to utilizing a CDN, to securing the website with SSL/TLS certificates.  In the end I opted for AWS because
        of how all of these services integrated with each other and most importantly, the cost.  The cost for a static website, depending on
        traffic, can be as cheap as $3.00 a month.  Granted the domain name gets renewed every year but the cost of that is only $12.00/year.

        This website is a static website that is hosted on AWS.  This site uses an S3 bucket to store the files that are served
        by AWS.  In order to speed delivery of this site to end-users, the use of a CloudFront Distribution is used to provide
        a CDN close to where users access AWS resources.  In keeping with best AWS practices, this site uses AWS's Origin Access
        Control to limit permissions when accessing the contents of the S3 bucket that contains the data for this site.  Additionally,
        this site used a SSL/TLS certificate issued by AWS's Certificate Manager.  AWS allows for the purchasing of domain names.  Therefore
        I purchased and renew this website's domain name every year.  Finally, the use of AWS's Route 53 is used to direct
        requests to the CloudFront distribution.
