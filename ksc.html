        <p>
          I received the honor of working at KSC on a Space Shuttle software project when it was still in operation.  The goal of the
          project was to replace the aging software and hardware that was being used to launch the Shuttle.  The existing system was
          all custom-built hardware and software--even the operating system called PC-GOAL was custom built.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to accomplish the task of replacing the hardware, the use of SUN Solaris servers and client machines was
          utilized.  Software was written in C/C++ for all back-end processing of data coming from the Shuttle's sensors.  The
          user interface was written in Java Swing.  At that time, Swing was a new product, not even included in the code JDK.
        </p>
        <p>
          My job was to make a layer that allowed the C/C++ code to communicate with the Java code.  In order to accomplish this,
          we used the Java Native Interface (JNI) API.  At that time, CORBA was very popular.  Therefore, used CORBA for client-server
          communication between hosts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We worked closely with employees from SUN Microsystems since we were both using their hardware and Java was written 
          by James Gosling, a SUN employee.  I was a junior software engineer at the time so I did not have a lot of exposure to
          the architecture creation.  However, I was in charge of documenting the JNI layer, which was very large.  I used UML
          for class diagrams and sequence diagrams.  One of the proudest moments I had was two-fold.  Unknowing to one of the SUN
          architects and and I, we both were working on a design for the JNI layer to relay sensor events from the Shuttle to the
          Java UI.  After the fact, our architecture was almost identical!  Additionally, one of the requirements was for a certain
          piece of information to be sent from a sensor to the UI twice a second.  The SUN architect and I were talking and he was
          very surprised that the code I had written was able to handle this rate of data over a sustained amount of time, usually
          for hours to days at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, as we all know, the Shuttle was retired and therefore the project was canceled.  This role did provide
          me a wealth of knowledge for creating software systems and gave me a spring-board for my next role with Riptide Software
          (now Phoenix Defense) which is where I'm still at today.
