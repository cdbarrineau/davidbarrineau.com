        Marines are famous for their use of rifles and their marksmanship.  They must qualify to use their weapons annually in
        order to be able to use their weapons.  KDAS is comprised of a fixed set of targets on different lanes with one shooter
        per lane.  If there are 40 lanes, they can qualify 40 Marines at a time.  Each training exercise is comprised of a set
        of timed intervals they have to complete some number of shots.  At the end of the training exercise, they must hit the
        target a fixed amount of times in order to qualify.  When a Marine is done with their exercise, they are given a PDF
        printout of their results a.k.a a "scorecard".  If a Marine does not meet the standard, they must try again until they
        qualify.
      </p>
      <p class="case-study-p">
        Prior to the KDAS solution, Marines would manually keep track of where shots landed on a silhouette.  This involved a
        "spotter" that sat beside a shooter looking through a magnifying glass at where a shot landed on a silhouette then
        attempting to mark on a piece of paper where the shot landed.  This obviously has severe limitations.  First, the
        spotter could be off on the placement of the shot.  Even as much as a millimeter on one shot can be the difference between a
        Marine qualifying or not.  Second, there is the possibility that the spotter was generous with a shot's placement.  For
        instance, the shot could have landed just outside of a Destroy zone but the spotter marked the shot as in the zone.  Additionally,
        if a shot was way outside of a silhouette, the spotter would have no idea if the shot was high, low, too much left or right.
        Finally, the amount of time involved in this training process limited the number of Marines that could train during a given
        time, for KDAS usually two days.
      </p>
      <p class="case-study-p">
        In order to take the human out of the equation, the KDAS solution was developed to rely on the hardware to detect the shots,
        relay that information to the control software which would allow the shooter to dynamically see where the shot landed.  This
        not only helps for accurate scoring and placement of the shots on a user's view of the silhouette but it also accurately
        scores a shooter.  Additionally, the KDAS system allows for a higher throughput of shooters by automating the scoring.  One
        Master Gunner estimated that the time for a training event was cut down by roughly 60%.
      </p>
      <p class="case-study-p">
        In order to receive where the shots were fired on a silhouette, I worked with a hardware vendor that developed sensors 
        to create an Interface Control Document (ICD) that allowed the firmware of the sensor to communicate to the software
        system that consumed the shot data, displayed the shots, and scored a shooter.  The computers onboard the hardware were
        able to handle more processing power than traditional targety devices so we used RabbitMQ with MQTT protocol for data
        inbound and outbound to and from the devices from the control software system.
      </p>
      <p class="case-study-p">
        I was tasked with developing a training software system for automated scoring for their training by myself.  I worked closely
        with a Subject Matter Expert (SME) and a Master Gunner to develop the requirements for the software system.  Having
        a good set of requirements, I was able to develop the training software from the ground up from the ICD to the printed
        scorecards.  We wanted the ability to run the software on a small device so the software architecture is a Modulith
        written in Java using Spring Boot.  We also used PostgreSQL for storing data and JPA for data access.  Being a Modulith,
        special care was taken to ensure that each component in the application could be extensible.  For this, I used the SOLID
        principle with Domain Driven Design.  The main control software, Spring Boot application also had to communicate with
        remote clients on tablets and other small devices.  In order to accomplish this, the clients were written in Angular
        using HTML and CSS.  This way, there was no additional software to load on the clients--they just used the web browser.  The
        communication from the client to the server was done via RESTful API calls.  Events from the server to the client also used
        RabbitMQ with the MQTT protocol.  The use of MQTT was two-fold.  First, wifi signal strength is sometimes spotty at best.
        MQTT was developed for IoT devices so this was the best solution over things like straight WebSocket implementations.  Secondly,
        MQTT has a very small data packet size as compared to other protocols like AMQP.

        The view to the left is what a shooter (a.k.a Student) sees on a tablet at the firing line.  The view shows the lane
        they are on, at what distance they are firing at and how many rounds they have shot.  The center shows a graphical view
        of the physical target's silhouette along with where their shots on the silhouette are (the numbered circles).  Depending
        on where they place the shots on the silhouette, the shooter is graded on where the shot placements are.  In this picture,
        the shooter has placed shots in the "Destroy" zone indicated by the lower-right orange "D".
