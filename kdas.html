            Marines are famous for their use of rifles and their marksmanship.  They must qualify to use their weapons annually in
            order to be able to use their weapons.  KDAS is comprised of a fixed set of targets on different lanes with one shooter
            per lane.  If there are 40 lanes, they can qualify 40 Marines at a time.  Each training exercise is comprised of a set
            of timed intervals they have to complete some number of shots.  At the end of the training exercise, they must hit the
            target a fixed amount of times in order to qualify.  When a Marine is done with their exercise, they are given a PDF
            printout of their results a.k.a "scorecard".  If a Marine does not meet the standard, they must try again until they
            qualify.

            In order to receive where the shots were fired on a silhouette, I worked with a hardware vendor that developed sensors 
            to create an Interface Control Document (ICD) that allowed the firmware of the sensor to communicate to the software
            system that consumed the shot data, displayed the shots, and scored a shooter.  The computers onboard the hardware were
            able to handle more processing power than traditional targety devices so we used RabbitMQ with MQTT protocol for data
            inbound and outbound to and from the devices from the control software system.
          </p>

            I was tasked with developing a training software system for automated scoring for their training by myself.  I worked closely
            with a Subject Matter Expert (SME) and a Master Gunner to develop the requirements for the software system.  Having
            a good set of requirements, I was able to develop the training software from the ground up from the ICD to the printed
            scorecards.  We wanted the ability to run the software on a small device so the software architecture is a Modulith
            written in Java using Spring Boot.  We also used PostgreSQL for storing data and JPA for data access.  Being a Modulith,
            special care was taken to ensure that each component in the application could be extensible.  For this, I used the SOLID
            principle with Domain Driven Design.  The main control software, Spring Boot application also had to communicate with
            remote clients on tablets and other small devices.  In order to accomplish this, the clients were written in Angular
            using HTML and CSS.  This way, there was no additional software to load on the clients--they just used the web browser.  The
            communication from the client to the server was done via RESTful API calls.  Events from the server to the client also used
            RabbitMQ with the MQTT protocol.  The use of MQTT was two-fold.  First, wifi signal strength is sometimes spotty at best.
            MQTT was developed for IoT devices so this was the best solution over things like straight WebSocket implementations.  Secondly,
            MQTT has a very small data packet size as compared to other protocols like AMQP.

            The view to the left is what a shooter (a.k.a Student) sees on a tablet at the firing line.  The view shows the lane
            they are on, at what distance they are firing at and how many rounds they have shot.  The center shows a graphical view
            of the physical target's silhouette along with where their shots on the silhouette are (the numbered circles).  Depending
            on where they place the shots on the silhouette, the shooter is graded on where the shot placements are.  In this picture,
            the shooter has placed shots in the "Destroy" zone indicated by the lower-right orange "D".
