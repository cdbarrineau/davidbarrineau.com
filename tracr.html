            The Targetry Range Automated Control and Recording (TRACR) system is a light-weight soltion that has been in use for almost two 
            decades.  It can be run on something as small as a Windows tablet and is extensible to be run as a full suite of plugins that
            allow for desktop users to run video of the training, After Action Reviews (AAR), and Take Home Packages which is the video and
            scoring data for their training exercise(s).

            TRACR was written in a time when CORBA was still prominent.  Therefore, all architecture bas based around CORBA.  TRACR is a 
            monolith architecture because it was written to be run on small devices, all self-contained.  The only external source that
            TRACR used was PostgreSQL.  The reason for CORBA was that one of the requirements is that it had to be compatible with a larger
            Product Line which used CORBA.  Therefore, because we knew that we would never integrate our software components with the Product
            Line, we were able to stub out a lot of the CORBA functionality along with Service Locator Provider (SLP) to all be localhost.
